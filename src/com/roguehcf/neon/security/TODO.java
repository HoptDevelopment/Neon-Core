	 * TODO
	 * 
	 * 1. Make all messages configurable
	 * 2. Make /login command, only allow players to login with the last IP they executed /login with (maybe add email message to confirm, or make an admin have to confirm) 
	 * 3. Make SecurePasswordFactory use hashing and salt.
	 * 4. Make a listener for PlayerJoinEvent which listens for a staff member to join, freezes them (with login message) and sends the message every 10 seconds with
	 * a Sound.NOTE_PLING 4F 4F and make them have to login to continue. Make it kick the player and alert staff after 3 failed attempts.
	 * 5. Pretty sure thats all we need to do, maybe make a scoreboard message?
	 * 6. Alert online staff if a staff account attempts to join whilst it is still online. eg real staff member online, hacker attempts to join on their account.
